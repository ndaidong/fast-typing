# fast-typing

[FastTyping](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dgibeimfinglbfgimhiffmflgimlfffl) is a simple and clean tool that helps me improve typing speed, without seeing any ads. It's full offline and just has the features I really need but any other tool provides. 

[FastTyping](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dgibeimfinglbfgimhiffmflgimlfffl) is not for beginner, use it if you are already:

- typing with all 10 fingers
- at least 30 words per minute of speed

Hopefully that it is also useful for you.
